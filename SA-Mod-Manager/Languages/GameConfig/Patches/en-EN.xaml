    <system:String x:Key="GamePatches.XInputFix">XInput Fix</system:String>

    <system:String x:Key="GamePatches.HRTFSoundDesc">Sets DirectSound to use more advanced algorithms to process 3D sounds. This patch is unnecessary when BASS for SFX is enabled.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="GamePatches.KeepCamSettingsDesc">Fixes a vanilla bug that prevents Free Cam Settings from being saved properly when dying or loading a zone/act.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="GamePatches.FixVertexColorRenderingDesc" xml:space="preserve">Vanilla SADX deliberately ignores the mesh-provided vertex color and instead uses a global vertex color even when it shouldn't.&#x0a;&#x0a;This patch re-implements the functions to handle the case CORRECTLY and use the mesh-provided vertex colors.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="GamePatches.MaterialColorFixDesc" xml:space="preserve">This loops through all models in the game and replaces their material colors with white.&#x0a;&#x0a;This fixes various inconsistencies and makes the models look more like they do in the Gamecube and Dreamcast versions of the game.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="GamePatches.NodeLimitDesc" xml:space="preserve">SADX originally has a limit of 111 nodes per character for models and animations.&#x0a;&#x0a;This patch increases the limit to 255, enabling the integration of more modern and complex models into the game.</system:String>

    <system:String x:Key="GamePatches.SkyChaseResolutionFixDesc" xml:space="preserve">Makes Sky Chase work the same way at all screen resolutions. This fixes Tornado and reticle movement, as well as enemy fire rate.&#x0a;&#x0a;Obtaining score for emblems at resolutions higher than 640x480 is easier with this patch than in the vanilla game.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="GamePatches.Chaos2CrashFixDesc">Fixes a vanilla bug where beating Chaos 2 and restarting the boss was crashing the game.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="GamePatches.ChunkSpecularFixDesc">Fixes Specular on Chunk Models.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="GamePatches.E102NGonFixDesc">Fixes N-sided polygons (Gamma's Headlight) by using a triangle strip vertex buffer.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="GamePatches.ChaoPanelFixDesc">Fixes the UI Panel for Chao Stats to display properly.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="GamePatches.PixelOffSetFixDesc">Fixes subpixel misplacement of most 2D elements that can be noticed at higher resolutions.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="GamePatches.LightFixDesc">Fixes light incorrectly being applied on LandTables and enables light type preservation for queued models.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="GamePatches.KillGBIXDesc" xml:space="preserve">Global Index (GBIX) is a value used in the game's texture caching system. Each texture in SADX has one.&#x0a;Before the game loads a new texture, it compares the new texture's GBIX value with indices of other textures that are already loaded.&#x0a;If a match is found, the game reuses the already loaded texture instead of loading the new one.&#x0a;&#x0a;This patch disables most of the GBIX system in the game to reduce texture errors/conflicts. (A few exceptions like HUD elements apply.)</system:String>
	<system:String x:Key="GamePatches.DisableCDCheckDesc">Disables the game's CD check.</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="GamePatches.ExtendedSaveSupportDesc">Enables support for saved games from the Steam version and allows custom save names (up to 48 characters).</system:String>
    <system:String x:Key="GamePatches.CrashGuardDesc" xml:space="preserve">Prevents common crashes with missing textures and missing binary files.&#x0a;&#x0a;This will not prevent the game from crashing in all circumstances.</system:String>
